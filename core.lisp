;; This is a hacked together program designed to generate the build

;; bugs or better ways to do things then send in patches.
;; 
;; Things that need doing:
;;     * Support for clisp, cmucl, ccl, and I guess others
;;     * build targets (ala make) (could be a plugin)
;;     * testing. It works for me, it might not for you
